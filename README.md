# Demava

**Demava** is an open-source platform designed to enable transparent, participatory, and domain-based governance — bottom-up, not top-down. It empowers citizens, organizations, and institutions to propose, vote, and deliberate within a structured and inclusive decision-making process.

---

## 📛 Why "Demava"?

**Demava** is a fusion of two meaningful concepts:

* **Democracy** – the foundational principle of power belonging to the people
* **Ava (آوا)** – a Persian word meaning "voice"

Together, **Demava** means "the voice of democracy."

The name reflects our belief that democracy is not only about elections — it's about continuous dialogue, structured participation, and informed consent at every level of society.

## 🦅 Logo and Symbolism

Demava's logo includes two powerful Iranian symbols:

* **Mount Damavand** – the tallest mountain in Iran (5,610+ meters), representing stability, rootedness, and timeless civic strength.
* **Simorgh** – a legendary bird in Persian mythology symbolizing collective wisdom, freedom, and transcendence. It often represents the unity of many voices into one purposeful whole.

Together, they signify the rise of a new generation of participatory civic infrastructure.

## 🌍 Vision

* And eventually, entire nations
