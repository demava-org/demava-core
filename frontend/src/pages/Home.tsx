      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Demava introduces layered governance â€” decisions flow from the bottom up across 10 structured levels â€” encouraging transparency, diversity of thought, and grassroots innovation.

        It also includes a **contribution-based reputation system** and promotes helping underrepresented or developing communities by allowing experts to lend their knowledge where it's needed most.
