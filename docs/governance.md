# Demava Project Governance

This document outlines how the Demava project is governed, how decisions are made, and how contributors and stakeholders can participate in shaping its future.

---

## 🎯 Goals of Project Governance

* Ensure the platform evolves with transparency, fairness, and technical rigor
* Encourage global participation and stewardship
* Avoid centralization of control
* Build trust for long-term adoption in public and institutional contexts

---

## 🧱 Governance Structure

### 1. **Core Team**

* Maintains the monorepo and CI/CD infrastructure
* Reviews and merges pull requests
* Approves releases and major refactors
* Sets strategic direction in collaboration with the community

### 2. **Working Groups** *(to be established)*

* Each group focuses on an area: frontend, backend, AI, UX, civic design, etc.
* Includes maintainers and active contributors
* Responsible for roadmap within their domain

### 3. **Community Contributors**

* Anyone who submits PRs, comments, reviews, or issues
* Recognized in contributors list
* Can be nominated to working groups or core team

### 4. **Advisors & Civic Partners** *(optional)*

* NGOs, academics, or institutions who provide strategic guidance
* May participate in roadmap and policy proposals

---

## 🔄 Decision-Making Process

### Minor Changes

* Handled by maintainers via standard GitHub Issues/PRs
* Reviewed and approved by 1–2 core members

### Major Proposals (RFCs)

* Must be submitted via `/docs/proposals/` folder or GitHub Discussion
* Labeled as `proposal`, discussed publicly
* Requires:

  * Clear problem and motivation
  * Suggested implementation
  * Backwards compatibility considerations

### Approval Thresholds

* **2 of 3 maintainers** (or majority of working group) for core changes
* **Community signal** (via reactions, voting, or open thread support) is taken into account

---

## ⚖️ Voting on Roadmap Items (Future)

* Contributors or verified community members can vote on direction
* Votes are weighted by contribution level (or equally, depending on policy)
* May use the Demava platform itself for internal governance testing

---

## ✅ Maintainer Expectations

* Review PRs regularly and provide constructive feedback
* Maintain respectful and inclusive tone
* Coordinate releases and roadmap items
* Foster growth and mentorship in the community

---

## 🔄 Governance Evolution

* This model is not final — it evolves as the project grows
* Governance changes must be proposed, discussed, and ratified through the same RFC process

---
